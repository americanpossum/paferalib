<h1>Random Tidbits About Jim That People Have Asked For</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
To quickly date myself, I remember watching the OJ Simpson trial live during elementary school. I was driving to high school when news about Columbine broke on the radio. I heard about 9/11 from my buddy in physics class at college, then we all watched the second plane crash into the tower live during math class, afterwards all classes were canceled for the rest of the day. I visited New Orleans a month before Hurricane Katrina struck, and it felt really strange seeing all of those places afterwards on the news. If you read this paragraph and understood all of these names, then you are obviously an American who grew up during the 90s and we should get along just fine.
</p>

<h2>Programming</h2>

<p>
My programming career started on an old IBM PS/2 modifying GORILLA.BAS. Later, my dad bought a K6-233 desktop which was incredibly speedy compared to the old 486. In college, I switched to a Duron 700 desktop which was then upgraded to a Duron 1300 to help with compiling assignments (at least before I got tired of helping classmates with assignments and switched from a Computer Engineering degree to the Interdisciplinary Studies trio of English, Math, and Economics). After college, I went through a variety of laptops for work running through 26 states to various Kroger stores and other companies which needed to have their computers fixed, but lugging these bricks around (especially to various students' homes once I started using technology for teaching) finally got tiring and I decided to never have a laptop screen above 12 inches again. Dell's new XPS 13 might change my mind in the future.
</p>

<p>
Presently, I do most of my programming on my trust Acer C720 chromebook running Arch Linux and XFCE. My wife has a i5-2500K desktop which I use for converting videos to MP4 format. My son watches TV on a Raspberry Pi 2B where I've designed a web front-end to omxplayer to randomly play his videos. I use a Samsung Galaxy K Zoom (the only phone series with a 10x optical zoom) which is starting to get a bit old, and am considering a Huawei P8 Max for my next phone due to the 6.8 inch screen. My favorite phone of all time is still my old Nokia 900, with which most people who bought it would agree. I had high hopes for Jolla, but I fear that only the former Nokia could have competed with Apple and Google as the market is today. Microsoft did well with the Lumia 1020, but seems to have waived the white flag as of late.
</p>

<p>
My favorite desktop environment is XFCE, and I typically maximize every window with Winkey-A which I've setup in Openbox to automatically undecorate. I use SciTE and Android Studio on a common basis for editing code. For image editing, I use IrfanView, GIMP, and Imagemagick. For video editing, I use Avidemux and ffmpeg. I've used AngularJS, Ruby on Rails, dotnet, and the rest, but I still prefer to use my own custom libraries for ease of use and for efficiency. I have found using frameworks regardless of language to be like using Apple products: incredibly easy to use if your workflow matches the exact aim of the framework, but as soon as you do something outside of the workflow, you start running into massive amounts of work.
</p>

<p>
My favorite programming language is Python, but I spend most of my time in PHP and JavaScript nowadays. My roots are in C/C++ and Java (fond memories of Borland C++ and Java applets back when they were still new and shiny), but I use them seldomly now because it's so much faster to prototype something in Python than it is to do so in those languages.
</p>

<h2>Design</h2>

<p>
I'm not a fan of the most recent flat text designs from Apple and Google. For me, a button should look like a button, not some text in front of the background. Interactive elements should be highlighted and easily found at a glance. They should change on hover to indicate that they can be clicked upon, and when clicked, they should change to reflect that they have been clicked. That is the purpose behind the ButtonBar functions in paferpage.js. When done right, flat designs can be simple and clean, such as the DiRT 3 interface. When done wrong, they can look like a bunch of randomly placed text with no indication of what exactly you're suppose to do. 
</p>

<p>
Icons are very useful for saving space and adding style if your audience all can immediate recognize the meaning of the icon. For example, the play, stop, fast forward, and rewind buttons have been on remotes for decades and pretty much anyone who has ever used a VCR will know at a glance what these buttons do. The problem with icons is over-using them in contexts where they might not be familiar, which is why I tend to use text buttons on this site outside of the most common user actions at the top right bar. Internationalization brings another set of challenges where an icon in one place can have a completely different meaning to another place. In these situations, plain old text gets the message across much more easily and prevents many misunderstandings from taking place.
</p>

<p>
I am also not a fan of sudden changes in paradigm. Say what you want about Windows, but whenever you see a dialog box with OK, Cancel, and Apply buttons at the bottom, you know exactly what you're suppose to do. The auto-apply settings of Gnome and others is a small change, but since it can save many clicks, it is also a wecome change. Interacting with the user has been the same for decades, and familiarity breeds understanding and speed. That was why the Ribbon interface was such a big turnoff for those of us who had been using MS Office for years. It's true that the visual style is better for newer users who have never used Office before, but when you have already memorized the various toolbars and where exactly you need to click in order to do what you want. All of this could have been avoided if someone had just included an option to use the classic interface and everyone could have been happy, but as Windows 8 showed, Microsoft was slow to learn from their mistakes and programs such as Start8 and ClassicShell quickly became popular. When they reversed course and added the Start button back into Windows 10, most people were much happier.
</p>

<p>
I actually like the forced updates that Windows 10 brings. Everyone who has worked in the tech industry for some time is far too familiar with the old grandma who never updates her old eMachines desktop and has become a luxury hotel for viruses and trojans. For these users, forced security updates can save the rest of us a lot of headaches. For those of us who know what we're doing, we should be able to set a Group Policy to inhibit automatic updates until through testing has been done. It's still not quite as good as sudo apt-get dist-upgrade, but with the way that Windows updates are handled, it's a welcome compromise.
</p>

<p>
The buttons on this site are not based off of any previous windowing system, but are my attempt to bring the LCARS interface from Star Trek into a realistic setting. If you've watched the show, you know that most of the buttons don't actually have any labels beyond the initials of cast and crew, but viewed from far away give the impression of a nice, shiny, futuristic interface. 
</p>

<h2>Media</h2>

<p>
My favorite books are by Stephen Baxter and J. R. R. Tolkien. I am also one of those weirdos who found the Simarillion to be more fascinating than the Lord of the Rings because I enjoy mythology and esoteric knowledge. If you laughed out loud in the theater when you watched X-Men and heard Cyclops say the line about yellow spandex, we'll probably get along just fine.
</p>

<p>
My favorite television shows of all time are Frasier, Cowboy Bebop, and Star Trek: The Next Generation. I enjoy Modern Family, the Office, and Futurama, but they just don't have the same rewatch value for me as the first three. Frasier has, in my opinion, the perfect touch of that bittersweet feeling you have when you have throughly loved something but know that it has to end that is unmatched by anything else that I have seen. Being stuck on a deserted island is never a good situation, but having eleven seasons of Frasier to watch will make it much more bearable.
</p>

<p>
My favorite movie is Message in a Bottle with Kevin Costner and Robin Wright, particularly for the beautiful ocean scenes (The fact that the Outer Banks is my favorite place to visit doesn't hurt either). I also enjoy Momento, Inception, and pretty much anything that requires thinking before understanding.
</p>

<p>
I prefer strategy games such as Civilization 3 or Master of Orion 2. Many entries of the Final Fantasy series have also given me fond memories. I also play chess, poker, and D&amp;D from time to time, but have found it rather difficult to find anyone to play with in China. The people around here tend to play Majong above all else.
</p>

<p>
I've been on Slashdot since 1999, but recently I find myself visiting Arstechnica and Screenrant more and more. I think that's true for most of us who grew up in the 90s as we've gotten older and gradually have less time to invest in long commentaries with people who don't really know what they're talking about. The best thing about Slashdot back in the day is that the people who made the news were also frequent visitors of the site, so you could actually discuss the topic with the very people who were experts in it. Nowadays, people have moved on, and it's harder and harder to find intelligent conversation on the web since everyone is so scattered all over the place.
</p>

<p>
I follow football (American football, for those of you who are soccer fans) and tennis, but my favorite sport is still basketball because no matter if you're by yourself or if you've got twenty people by your side, everyone can still play. My favorite players are Michael Jordan, Tim Duncan, and Bill Russell. I enjoy Kobe's skill, but not his style. The same goes for LeBron, who bulldozes people too often for my liking.
</p>

<h2>Beliefs</h2>

<p>
I believe that teaching is not about forcing curriculum into a student's head, but being able to give them the excitement that they need to crave learning itself. The former is something that a free book from the library can do, but the latter is something that requires having a special person beside you. 
</p>

<p>
I do support standardized tests on a national level, but I don't support funding based upon test scores because those scores are so dependent upon culture and home support. Expecting inner city Detriot and Georgetown students to have the same test scores is ridiculous.
</p>

<p>
I am neither Democrat, Republican, Libertarian, Green, or anything that you might want to name as a label. I am, however, a firm believer in self-determination, the quest for knowledge, and freedom of choice for all sentient beings ala Optimus Prime. The closest to my personal utopia that I have read would be <a data-nointercept=1 href="http://marshallbrain.com/manna1.htm">Marshall Brain's Australian Project</a>. It's unlikely to ever happen in reality, but then again, dreams and hopes are what separate us from other animals. Like many fellow geeks, I happily cheer Tesla, SpaceX, Blue Origins, and other such companies for doing what NASA and the established companies should have done but couldn't while pandering to congressional pork projects. The country that first put men on the moon becoming the country that has to hitch a ride with the Russians because we no longer had our own launch capabilities did not sit well with any of us.
</p>

<p>
I believe in a higher power simply because I can't imagine that we were accidentally given consciousness and our other abilities by a random mutation from a primate. Scientifically possible and probable are very separate things, just like a bunch of virtual particles spontaneously coalescing into your computer. Quite possible by the laws of quantum mechanics, but the probability is astronomically small.
</p>

<h2>Social</h2>

<p>
My favorite pasttimes are basketball, hiking, watching movies, and improving code. Recently, I find that as long as I see my son calmly sleeping beside me, I can serenely do just about anything.
</p>

<p>
My favorite type of vacation is going on cruises simply because you only need to unpack once and you can wake up everyday in a different place. The large ships with 24 hour dining are also quite convenient. When I'm older, I'll probably try a trans-Atlantic cruise just for the sheer spectacle of spending two months at sea like the sailors of the old days. 
</p>

<p>
I speak English, Chinese, and a little bit of Spanish and Russian. The next language and culture that I'd like to immerse myself in would be Spain, France, or Germany to get the feel of what it's like to be an European. I'll probably visit Africa and South America when my son goes to college and I don't need to be beside him as much. Hopefully by then, there will be many tourists going to Anarctica so that I can say that I've been on all seven continents. I find that merely speaking a language is insufficent to proper communication. In order to use the language correctly, you must spend time living in the place of that language in order to understand the culture and mindset behind the words. Most people who have spent a lot of time traveling will probably agree with me.
</p>

<p>
My favorite styles of food are American, Mexican, Chinese, and Italian. I prefer cooking my own food, but I also enjoy both the common and the special tastes as well. My ideal day on vacation eating out would probably be Hardee's biscuits and gravy for breakfast, Wendy's spicy chicken sandwich and chili for lunch, then a small steak and the bar at Country Cookin or equivalent for dinner. Plain, simple, and available at most places in the east coast. 
</p>

<p>
I don't often drink except for a glass of wine with steamed fish from time to time. I prefer orange juice, chocolate milk, and Mountain Dew, which unfortunately China does not stock among pretty much every other major soda.
</p>

<p>
I'm not someone who likes to stay in five star hotels and order room service. If I go somewhere, I want to be outside getting to know the place. I enjoy exploring and visiting places where few people have gone. The vast majority of the time, there's nothing to find, but every once in a while, you can stumble onto a gem that no one has found before. 
</p>

<p>
I actively avoid Facebook, Google+, and any other company which likes to sell personal information and has lax privacy standards. I'm old enough to remember the days of MySpace, LiveJournal, and Geocities along with AOL, Compuserve, and BBSs before them. If you want to talk, give me a call. If you need help with homework, send me an email. If you want to talk long distance, look me up on Skype. I am not a neurosurgeon who is on call 24 hours a day, and I will turn off my phone when I'm driving, eating, watching a movie, or simply want to relax. When it's time to work, I work. When it's time to play, I play. As long as you accept that, you shouldn't have any problems reaching me.
