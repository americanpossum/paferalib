<h1>Random Tidbits About Jim That People Have Asked For</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
To quickly date myself, I remember watching the OJ Simpson trial live during elementary school. I was driving to high school when news about Columbine broke on the radio. I heard about 9/11 from my buddy in physics class at college, then we all watched the second plane crash into the tower live during math class, afterwards all classes were canceled for the rest of the day. I visited New Orleans a month before Hurricane Katrina struck, and it felt really strange seeing all of those places afterwards on the news. I'm sure that everyone who was in the U.S. during these events can all remember when and where they were, and that is our shared bond.
</p>

<h2>Programming</h2>

<p>
My programming career started on an old IBM PS/2 modifying GORILLA.BAS. Later, my dad bought a K6-233 desktop which was incredibly speedy compared to the old 486. In college, I switched to a Duron 700 desktop which was then upgraded to a Duron 1300 to help with compiling assignments (at least before I got tired of helping classmates with assignments and switched from a Computer Engineering degree to the Interdisciplinary Studies trio of English, Math, and Economics). After college, I went through a variety of laptops for work running through 26 states to various Kroger stores and other companies which needed to have their computers fixed, but lugging these bricks around (especially to various students' homes once I went into teaching) finally got tiring and I decided to never have a laptop screen above 12 inches again. Dell's new XPS 13 might change my mind in the future.
</p>

<p>
Presently, I do most of my programming on my trust Acer C720 chromebook running Arch Linux. My wife has a i5-2500K desktop which I use for converting videos to MP4 format. My son watches TV on a Raspberry Pi 2B where I've designed a web front-end to omxplayer to randomly play his videos. I use a Samsung Galaxy K Zoom (the only phone series with a 10x optical zoom) which is starting to get a bit old, and am considering a Huawei P8 Max for my next phone. My favorite phone of all time is still my old Nokia 900, with which most people who bought it would agree. I had high hopes for Jolla, but I fear that only the former Nokia could have competed with Apple and Google as the market is today. Microsoft did well with the Lumia 1020, but seems to have waived the white flag as of late.
</p>

<p>
My favorite desktop environment is XFCE, and I typically maximize every window with Winkey-A which I've setup in Openbox to automatically undecorate. I use SciTE and Android Studio on a common basis for editing code. For image editing, I use IrfanView, GIMP, and Imagemagick. For video editing, I use Avidemux and ffmpeg. I've used AngularJS, Ruby on Rails, dotnet, and the rest, but I still prefer to use my own custom libraries for ease of use and for efficiency. I have found using frameworks regardless of language to be like using Apple products: incredibly easy to use if your workflow matches the exact aim of the framework, but as soon as you do something outside of the workflow, you start running into massive amounts of work.
</p>

<p>
My favorite programming language is Python, but I spend most of my time in PHP and JavaScript nowadays. My roots are in C/C++ and Java (fond memories of Borland C++ and Java applets back when they were still new and shiny), but I use them seldomly now because it's so much faster to prototype something in Python than it is to do so in those languages.
</p>

<h2>Media</h2>

<p>
My favorite books are by Stephen Baxter and J. R. R. Tolkien. I am also one of those weirdos who found the Simarillion to be more fascinating than the Lord of the Rings because I enjoy mythology and esoteric knowledge. If you laughed out loud in the theater when you watched X-Men and heard Cyclops say the line about yellow spandex, we'll probably get along just fine.
</p>

<p>
My favorite television shows of all time are Frasier, Cowboy Bebop, and Star Trek: The Next Generation. I enjoy Modern Family, the Office, and Futurama, but they just don't have the same rewatch value for me as the first three. Frasier has, in my opinion, the perfect touch of that bittersweet feeling you have when you have throughly loved something but know that it has to end that is unmatched by anything else that I have seen. Being stuck on a deserted island is never a good situation, but having eleven seasons of Frasier to watch will make it much more bearable.
</p>

<p>
My favorite movie is Message in a Bottle with Kevin Costner and Robin Wright, particularly for the beautiful ocean scenes (The fact that the Outer Banks is my favorite place to visit doesn't hurt either). I also enjoy Momento, Inception, and pretty much anything that requires thinking before understanding.
</p>

<p>
I've been on Slashdot since 1999, but recently I find myself visiting Arstechnica and Screenrant more and more. I think that's true for most of us who grew up in the 90s as we've gotten older and gradually have less time to invest in long commentaries with people who don't really know what they're talking about.
</p>

<p>
I follow football (American football, for those of you who are soccer fans) and tennis, but my favorite sport is still basketball because no matter if you're by yourself or if you've got twenty people by your side, everyone can still play. My favorite players are Michael Jordan, Tim Duncan, and Bill Russell. I enjoy Kobe's skill, but not his style. The same goes for LeBron, who bulldozes people too often for my liking.
</p>

<h2>Beliefs</h2>

<p>
I believe that teaching is not about forcing curriculum into a student's head, but being able to give them the excitement that they need to crave learning itself. The former is something that a free book from the library can do, but the latter is something that requires having a special person beside you. 
</p>

<p>
I do support standardized tests on a national level, but I don't support funding based upon test scores because those scores are so dependent upon culture and home support. Expecting inner city Detriot and Georgetown students to have the same test scores is ridiculous.
</p>

<p>
I am neither Democrat, Republican, Libertarian, Green, or anything that you might want to name as a label. I am, however, a firm believer in self-determination, the quest for knowledge, and freedom of choice for all sentient beings ala Optimus Prime. The closest to my personal utopia that I have read would be <a data-nointercept=1 href="http://marshallbrain.com/manna1.htm">Marshall Brain's Australian Project</a>. It's unlikely to ever happen in reality, but then again, dreams and hopes are what separate us from other animals.
</p>

<p>
I believe in a higher power simply because I can't imagine that we were accidentally given consciousness and our other abilities by a random mutation from a primate. Scientifically possible and probable are very separate things, just like a bunch of virtual particles spontaneously coalescing into your computer. Quite possible by the laws of quantum mechanics, but the probability is astronomically small.
</p>

<h2>Social</h2>

<p>
My favorite pasttimes are basketball, hiking, watching movies, and improving code. Recently, I find that as long as I see my son calmly sleeping beside me, I can serenely do just about anything.
</p>


<p>
My favorite type of vacation is going on cruises simply because you only need to unpack once and you can wake up everyday in a different place. The large ships with 24 hour dining are also quite convenient. When I'm older, I'll probably try a trans-Atlantic cruise just for the sheer spectacle of spending two months at sea like the sailors of the old days. 
</p>

<p>
I speak English, Chinese, and a little bit of Spanish and Russian. The next language and culture that I'd like to immerse myself in would be Spain, France, or Germany to get the feel of what it's like to be an European. I'll probably visit Africa and South America when my son goes to college and I don't need to be beside him as much. Hopefully by then, there will be many tourists going to Anarctica so that I can say that I've been on all seven continents. 
</p>

<p>
I actively avoid Facebook and any other company which likes to sell personal information and has lax privacy standards. I'm old enough to remember the days of MySpace, LiveJournal, and Geocities along with AOL, Compuserve, and BBSs before them. If you want to talk, give me a call. If you need help with homework, send me an email. I am not a neurosurgeon who is on call 24 hours a day, and I will turn off my phone when I'm driving, eating, watching a movie, or simply want to relax. As long as you accept that, you shouldn't have any problems reaching me.
