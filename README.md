PHP Framework for Rapid Application Development

After a couple of years of hacking this in my spare time, I feel that my API is stable enough for other people to play around with this code as well. It's released under the GPL, so feel free to use it, fork it, or do anything else that you want as long as you send me any improvements.

Please see <a href="https://www.pafera.com/projects/paferalib">the official documentation</a> at www.pafera.com for further details.
